19 August 2012:

- The grid side of the job is almost done. 
- A first "follow" version of the monte carlo has been implemented.
- Observation of the behaviour of such seem to show that using the "follwing" algorithm, 
then the error of the integration decreases really slowly, BUT the result does seem to be very unstable. 
While the results of different patterns of the same sub-region seem to be similar, with the "follow" algorithm
the results have a __very high variance__.
